# Triangle Ice Cream
This is an app that fetches data using [Zomato's](https://www.zomato.com/) API to location ice cream shop in North Carolina's Research Triangle area.
Those locations are then plotted on a map provided by [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) API. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
